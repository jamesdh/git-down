=======

Git Down is a simple webapp for perusing and downloading GitHub issues in CSV format. 

Runs entirely off of [GitHub's API's](http://developer.github.com/). Uses [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) for modeling/views, [backbone.stickit](https://github.com/nytimes/backbone.stickit) for a dash of two-way binding, [downloadify](https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify) for a lightweight means of downloading results, and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for quick and dirty styling. 

Give it a try at [http://jamesdh.github.com/git-down](http://jamesdh.github.com/git-down)
